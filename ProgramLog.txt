Framework set up for Tweeting images, it works! Next steps are to:
	- get Instagram posting images too
	- program maturity for image generation
	- set up timer to Tweet images regularly (should only take a few minutes to do)
	- Set up Bash script? or something to allow program to run in background but still be killable

Set up WSL on server in order to kick off future cron job
This will allow me to kill the script easily and won't be using Windows scheduled job
Need to determine smooth way to get code over to server, maybe an automatic checkout from Github?

Another idea of something to add: log data attached to each generate image outlining params
