# Gradient

Gradient is an image generator bot which creates or modiefies a random image and posts it to Twitter. Python and OpenCV are the current idea. This will definitely be a flexible program. :-)

Future pieces of code to program:
- Twitter/Instagram login and posting to account on a time interval
- Image online collection and storage
- Saving image and calling up old images
	- Auto delete after so long
